# Simple Anomaly Detection in Time Series via Optimal Baseline Subtraction (OBS)
**Anomaly detection** in time series is used to identify unexpected patterns in your time series. The number of applications of Anomaly Detection in Time Series is huge. In **energy engineering**, a spike in power usage might signal a fault. In **finance**, sudden drops or peaks can indicate major market events. In **mechanical systems**, unusual vibrations may reveal early signs of failure.

If you have a bank of time series and you want to understand if and in what portion of the time series you have an anomaly, a simple but very efficient metod is called **optimal baseline subtraction (OBS)**. It is based on comparing [...]
