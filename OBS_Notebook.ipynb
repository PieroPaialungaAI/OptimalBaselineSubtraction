    "# Simple Anomaly Detection in Time Series via Optimal Baseline Subtraction (OBS)\n",
    "**Anomaly detection** in time series is used to identify unexpected patterns in your time series, and it is widely applied in different fields. In **energy engineering**, a spike in power usage might signal a fault. In **finance**, sudden drops or peaks can indicate major market events. In **mechanical systems**, unusual vibrations may reveal early signs of failure. In this blogpost, we will use **weather data** as an example use case, and we will find the anomalies in temperature time series for different cities all over the world.  \n",

    "## Optimal Baseline Subtraction (OBS) Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### OBS Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a bank of time series and you want to understand if and in what portion of the time series you have an anomaly, a simple but very efficient metod is called **optimal baseline subtraction (OBS)**. OBS is based on comparing each time series segment to the most similar historical pattern and analyzing the difference to detect unexpected deviations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### OBS Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The OBS algorithm is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Split the time series into individual segments**, where each segment represents a unit of repeated behavior (e.g., a day, a cycle, or a process run).\n",
    "- **Build a library of historical segments** by collecting all previous segments in the time series bank.\n",
    "- **Compare your target segment** with all other segments in the library using a similarity metric, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n",
    "- **Select the most similar segment** from the library as the optimal baseline.\n",
    "- **Subtract the baseline from the target segment** to isolate the residual (i.e., the difference).\n",
    "- **Analyze the residual** to identify large deviations, which are flagged as potential anomalies.\n",
